#Build Something Of Your Choice
F1 Teams & Drivers 2025 - blog

Project Description:
This project is basically a blog that introduces the various Formula 1 teams and drivers for the 2025 season since the drivers tends to change every season and even at times within the season. I intend to build on this some more once I have more time since this is also a Passion Project!

Why I Chose This Project:
I chose to work on this project because the world of F1 is constantly evolving. Drivers change teams, new talent emerges, and the dynamics of the sport shift every season. I wanted to create a blog that tracks these developments and provides an accessible and engaging way for other fans to stay informed about the teams and drivers competing in 2025. This project allows me to combine my love for F1 with my interest in web development and blogging.
